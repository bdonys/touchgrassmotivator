# Touch Grass Motivator 
 
We wanted to help motivate Leauge of Legend players to either step their game up or go outside to "touch grass." We deveoloped an application that allows you to enter your Summoner Id and the region you are in and it will show you your current rank and a gif based on what your rank is. Our app runs using the Giphy API to pull up the gif and then Riot Api to pull up the global rankings. 

## User Story

AS A Legue of Legends player 
I WANT to be motivated based on my rank 
SO THAT I can stop seeing the same rank output

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I want to be motivated to climb 
WHEN a summoner name is inputted from a specific server region 
THEN a rank and tier of the summoner is outputted with a motivational gif

## Usage

The riot API that we are using requires you to reset your API key every 24 hours. 

## Additional Resouces 

First you need to select the region of which your summoner id is from underneath the "Select Your Region!" message![Screenshot](<./Screenshot 2023-09-21 204514.png>). After that you want to enter your summoner id into the summoner name box![Screenshot](<./Screenshot 2023-09-21 204528.png>). Once you Do that and hit the submit button if the name you enter has a rank it will show up with a motivational gif![Screenshot](<./Screenshot 2023-09-21 204544.png>). If the summoner name does not have a Rank a message that says "summoner has no rank" will be displayed with a confused gif instead![Screenshot](<./Screenshot 2023-09-21 210036.png>).
